Game: "BrainLord" (MasterMind)

Instructions for running the game:

1. 	The following files describe necessary classes and functions 
	and must be in the same directory as "game_driver.py":
	- BLapp.py
	- board.py
	- functions.py
	- pegs.py
	- row.py
	Please see the comments in each of these files to see what classes they describe.
	
	The following file lists the game rules, and must also be in the same directory:
	- rules.txt 
	
	
2. 	To run the game, simply run "game_driver.py" with Python 3
	For example:
		Anjanas-MacBook-Air:Sheet6 Anjana$ python3 game_driver.py

	This will launch the GUI for the game.

3.	The game stores all the player names and scores in a file called "scores.txt".
	The first time the game is played in the given directory, this file will be created.
	After that, the app will read the "scores.txt" file and display the high scores
	on the "High Scores" page.
	Deleting this file will erase all the scores in the game's memory.
	
4.	Have fun, thanks for playing!
